Created with: React/JS frontend, Express/JS backend, and MongoDB. Styles with HTML/CSS.

# Backend
- Open Command Prompt.
- Copy all Github files/folders onto your computer (excluding the 'src' folder; that's all frontend).
- Run 'cd (drag and drop the "server" folder into Command Prompt)' and hit enter.
- It should look something like this:
	- C: \Users|"the user"\Desktop\"server folder name">
- Install all needed dependencies with the follow command:
	- 'npm install --save express mongoose dotenv nodemon' 
- Run 'code .' to see the backend on VisualStudioCode
- Run 'npm run start' to run the backend

# Frontend
- Open Command Prompt
Copy the Github file called "src" onto your computer; this is the entire frontend
- Drop the "server" folder into Command Prompt like the Backend, but delete the part of the directory where it shows the "server" folder. It should look like this:
	- C:\Users\"the user"\Desktop>
- Run 'cd src' or whatever you decide to call the frontend folder
- Run `npm install` to install all Node.js dependencies for the React frontend.
- Run 'code .' to see the frontend on VisualStudioCode
